# Changelog

All notable flash-package / firmware iterations for PineBuds Pro CROS + SITE.
Format: version, date (UTC), then user-facing changes.

**This project is a work in progress and is not a functional CROS product.** DIY / own-risk - not a hearing aid or PPE.

## [0.2.4] — 2026-09-22

### Firmware
- Stage B chop rethink: **no BT work in AF DMA callback** — capture only copies PCM; 20 ms ticker encodes/sends
- Single latest-frame slot via `tws_ctrl` (depth 1, freshest audio, tx_done paced)
- Adaptive RX jitter buffer (40–120 ms) grows on underrun, shrinks when stable

## [0.2.3] — 2026-09-22

### Firmware
- Stage B: fix remaining chop — direct send never fired `tx_done`, so most frames were dropped; send every capture frame again
- 20 ms ADPCM frames (lower packet rate); RX underrun PLC (repeat last frame)

## [0.2.2] — 2026-09-22

### Firmware
- Stage B: fix ~1s delay / chop from TWS cmd queue backlog — **direct BESAUD send**, 1-packet inflight gate
- Soft limiter for loud mic spikes (nail-on-grille was dropping CROS)
- RX latency clamp (~60 ms max); shorter 10 ms ADPCM frames; quieter default gain

## [0.2.1] — 2026-09-22

### Firmware
- Stage B CROS: switch mic relay from raw PCM to **IMA-ADPCM** (~4:1) over TWS
- 20 ms frames, 2-packet TX pipeline, ~60 ms RX prebuffer — targets choppiness / early drop

## [0.2.0] — 2026-09-22

### Firmware
- **Stage B CROS (experimental):** poor-side FF mic → good-side speaker over TWS (IBRT custom cmd, raw 16 kHz PCM)
- Default poor side = **RIGHT** (override with `CROS_POOR_IS_RIGHT=0`)
- Quad-tap toggles CROS on/off and syncs mode to the peer (requires TWS link)
- Stage A local loopback remains in tree; Stage B build does not auto-start it

### Package
- New flash zip with Stage B firmware
- Docs: CROS feature README + flash notes for quad-tap CROS test

## [0.1.6] — 2026-09-21

### Package
- Fix backup/flash Sync hang: scripts prompt **out → start bestool → reseat** per bud (BES2300 bootloader must ACK Sync during reset)
- Same experimental firmware bin as v0.1.3–v0.1.5
- Docs (`BESTOOL.md` / windows-flash) match the correct Sync order

## [0.1.5] — 2026-09-21

### Package
- New flash zip with ASCII-safe `backup.ps1` (fixes Windows PowerShell parse error)
- Same experimental firmware bin as v0.1.3/v0.1.4

## [0.1.4] — 2026-09-21

### Package
- Fix `backup.ps1` parse error on Windows PowerShell (non-ASCII em dash in throw string)

## [0.1.3] — 2026-09-19

### Docs
- Public-facing README with a prominent **work in progress / not functional** banner
- Removed personal bring-up checklist and private progress log
- Feature READMEs state CROS and SITE modes are not implemented

### Package
- Regenerated flash zip with updated `FLASH.md` (experimental loopback notes only; not CROS)

## [0.1.2] — 2026-09-19

### Privacy
- Removed hardcoded account URLs from docs, packaging scripts, and zip manifests (relative paths only)
- Dropped older flash zips that embedded account URLs; republished experimental loopback bin
- Rewrote git history so early commits no longer carry a personal author email

### Firmware
- Same experimental loopback binary lineage as v0.1.1 (ASRMIC → FF mic table fix)

## [0.1.1] — 2026-09-19

### Firmware
- **Fix:** `cfg_audio_input_path_cfg` for `AUD_INPUT_PATH_ASRMIC` now uses `CFG_HW_AUD_INPUT_PATH_ASRMIC_DEV` (was wrongly wired to `MAINMIC_DEV` / talk mic)
- Confirmed `VOICE_DETECTOR_EN=0` on `open_source` so the ASRMIC `#else` branch is active

### Package
- Rebuild with `CROS_STAGE_A=1`

## [0.1.0] — 2026-09-19

First numbered flash package.

### Firmware
- Experimental same-bud FF (MIC1) → speaker loopback (16 kHz mono, soft gain, peak clip)
- Auto-starts after boot; **quad-tap** toggles loopback off/on
- Note: 0.1.0 bin still had the ASRMIC→MAINMIC table bug; use **0.1.1+**

### Package
- Includes `open_source.bin`, `flash.ps1`, `backup.ps1`, `FLASH.md`, `BESTOOL.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `VERSION`, `MANIFEST.txt`, `SHA256SUMS`
